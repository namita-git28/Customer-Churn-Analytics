# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset.

## Key Highlights
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTEENN
- Evaluated model using Recall, Precision, and F1-score
- Avoided data leakage by applying resampling only on training data
- Saved trained model using joblib for deployment

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Status
Model training completed. Deployment planned.
